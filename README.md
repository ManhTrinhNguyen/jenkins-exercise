#### This project is for the DevOps bootcamp exercise for

#### "Build Automation with Jenkins"

##### Test
The project uses jest library for tests. (see "test" script in package.json)
There is 1 test (server.test.js) in the project that checks whether the main index.html file exists in the project. 

To run the nodejs test:

    npm run test

Make sure to download jest library before running test, otherwise jest command defined in package.json won't be found.

    npm install

In order to see failing test, remove index.html or rename it and run tests.

### Technologies Used
- **Jenkins**
- **Groovy**
- **Docker**
- **Git**
- **Java**
- **Maven**

### Project Description
- Created a **Jenkins Shared Library (JSL)** to extract common build logic.
- Developed a separate Git repository for the JSL project.
- Wrote reusable functions in the JSL for use in Jenkins pipelines.
- Integrated and utilized the JSL in Jenkins pipelines globally and for specific projects in **Jenkinsfiles**.

## Project 3: Configure Webhook to Trigger CI Pipeline Automatically on Every Change

### Technologies Used
- **Jenkins**
- **GitLab**
- **Git**
- **Docker**
- **Java**
- **Maven**

### Project Description

## Project 4: Dynamically Increment Application Version in Jenkins Pipeline

### Technologies Used
- **Jenkins**
- **Docker**
- **GitLab**
- **Git**
- **Java**
- **Maven**

### Project Description
- Configured the CI pipeline to:

  - Build a Docker image with a dynamic Docker image tag.
  - Push the image to a private **DockerHub** repository.
  - Commit the version update back to the Git repository.
- Ensured the Jenkins pipeline did not trigger automatically on CI build commits to avoid commit loops.
